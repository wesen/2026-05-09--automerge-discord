/// BeeKEM is our variant of the [TreeKEM] protocol (used in [MLS]) and inspired by
/// [Matthew Weidner's Causal TreeKEM][Causal TreeKEM]. The distinctive
/// feature of BeeKEM is that when merging concurrent updates, we keep all concurrent
/// public keys at any node where there is a conflict (until they are overwritten by
/// a future update along that path). The conflict keys are used to ensure
/// that a passive adversary needs all of the historical secret keys at
/// one of the leaves in order to read the latest root secret after a merge.
///
/// Leaf nodes represent group members. Each member has a fixed identifier as well
/// as a public key that is rotated over time. Each inner node stores one or more
/// public keys and an encrypted secret used for (deriving a shared key for) decrypting
/// its parent.
///
/// During a key rotation, a leaf will update its public key and then encrypt its path
/// to the root. For each parent it attempts to encrypt, it will encounter one of a few
/// cases:
/// * In the "normal" case, the child's sibling will have a single public key and a
///   corresponding secret key. The child uses the public key of its sibling to derive
///   a shared Diffie Hellman (DH) secret. It then uses this shared DH secret to
///   encrypt the new parent secret.
/// * In case of a blank or conflict sibling, the encrypting child encrypts the secret
///   for each of the nodes in its sibling's resolution (which is the set of the highest
///   non-blank, non-conflict descendents of the sibling). This means a separate DH per
///   node in that resolution. These encryptions of the secret are stored in a map at
///   the parent.
