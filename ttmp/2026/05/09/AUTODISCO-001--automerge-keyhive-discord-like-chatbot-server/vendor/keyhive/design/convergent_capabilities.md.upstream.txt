# Convergent Capabilities

We propose naming this class of capabilities "Convergent Capabilities", or "concap" for short.

# Conventions

# Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


## Diagrams

There are several diagrams below. We use the following graphical conventions:

```mermaid
flowchart
    subgraph Legend
        doc(("Document"))
        capRW>"Edit Document"]
        capRR>"Read from Document"]

        alice(("Alice"))
        bob(("Bob"))

        abRR>Read from Document]
    end

    doc --- capRR ---> alice
    doc --- capRW --> alice

    abRR -.-o|"Proven by<br>earlier capability"| capRR

    alice ---|Alice delegates<br>Doc Read<br>to Bob| abRR --> bob
```
